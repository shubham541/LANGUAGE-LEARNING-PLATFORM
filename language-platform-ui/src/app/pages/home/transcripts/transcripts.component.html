    Hi, Jo.</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: Hello.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Thank you for talking to me today. What would you like to talk about?</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: So, I'm going to tell you about my recent visit to, erm, a very well-known restaurant and a
      very special restaurant.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: OK – great.</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: It's called El Celler de Can Roca&nbsp;and it's in Girona in Spain and, erm, it often comes
      in the, like, top two or three restaurants in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Wow!</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: And I went last week. And, well, the first thing that was exciting for us was to even get a
      table 'cause, erm, we booked a year ago and we had to go, you have to go, 'cause you can book a year in advance,
      so you have to go online at one minute to midnight a year before you think you could go and keep refreshing,
      refreshing the page until places become available and just go immediately and get the table. So, we were really
      excited to have the table and we were kind of nervous on Friday because we waited a whole year, so expectations
      were really high. And it was also, by chance, boiling hot in Girona and it was in the middle of a heatwave.&nbsp;It
      was 44 degrees.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Oh my goodness.</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: So, we were just waiting in our hotel room, couldn't go outside 'cause it was too hot, erm,
      kind of wondering what this dinner was going to be like, er, and getting all dressed up. So, yeah, we went and,
      well,&nbsp;the place is beautiful, all … I thought it would be quite, erm, it didn't really feel formal though.
      The staff were all really friendly and they showed us inside the kitchen first.&nbsp;And it's amazing 'cause&nbsp;no
      one is stressed in the kitchen – or they did a good job of pretending that they weren't. And they were making
      amazing things that looked like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for adults – little olive trees with amazing,
      like, erm, er, olive kind of confections hanging from them. And, yeah, the whole thing was amazing – a
      once-in-a-lifetime experience of lots of different courses of tiny, beautiful, surprising things, erm&nbsp;…</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What was the best dish that you had?</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: It was all amazing but I think the best thing for me was one of the desserts. I had a
      sheep-themed pudding …</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Wow!</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: So, it was all, erm – So, it was like a woolly sheep.&nbsp;It was like candy floss, like,
      made with, erm, like, sort of white sugar like you have at the fair. Erm, and that was supposed to represent the
      wool, and the sound of the spoon on the bowl made the sound of the bell on the sheep in the field.&nbsp;And then
      separately I had this thing to smell that smelled of wool. So I was, like, eating this sheep wool and smelling the
      smell of wool at the same time which, it sounds really weird, but it was actually delicious.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Sounds incredible!</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: It really was!&nbsp;It really was amazing.</p>

    <p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Wow.&nbsp;Thank you for telling us about it.</p>

    <p><strong>Jo</strong>: It's a pleasure.</p>
